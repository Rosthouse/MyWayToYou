==========

This is a javascript game engine that I made to explore the possibilities and limitations of HTML5.
It  was primarely written to see what is possible today with HTML5 as well as a fun project to kinda make a autobiographical game.

For this engine, no external javascript libraries were used (Not even jQuery).

Installation
------------
Simply download the whole repository and open index.html in your browser. No further installation needed.
